ColorPicker 1.0.5
=====================

**Custom Fieldtype/Inputfield for ProcessWire 2.+**

This module gives you a new custom Fieldtype. Let's you select a color using a Colorpicker jQuery Plugin. The color selected will be stored in HEX format uppercase: "EAEAEA";

To use it in your template as a background HEX color, you'd simple output the value and prefix it with a #:

```
echo "background-color: #" . $page->color;
```

When creating a new field in the admin, you can set a default value the field should be prefilled with when creating a new page. The field supports a "reset" button to be able to set it back to the default value.

The colorpicker used:
